                <h3>Rating: 5/5</h3>
                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>In the vein of The Pisces and The Vegetarian, Chlorine is a debut novel that blurs the line between a
                    literary coming-of-age narrative and a dark unsettling horror tale, told from an adult perspective
                    on the trials and tribulations of growing up in a society that puts pressure on young women and
                    their bodies... a powerful, relevant novel of immigration, sapphic longing, and fierce, defiant
                    becoming.</p>
                <h3>My Thoughts:</h3>
                <p>I chose this book because it had a cool looking cover, so I had no idea that it was a horror book. A
                    very well written an impressive debut book about competetive swimming, racism, the horror or growing
                    up as a woman, and having a strong urge of becoming a mermaid instead.</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at
                    an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the
                    humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality
                    they slip gradually from obsession to corruption and betrayal, and at last—inexorably—into evil.</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Fowl Eulogies is an absurd fairy tale for the ethical carnivore, fiction of perfect madness, of
                    brutal and unprecedented humor. From the meadow to the supermarket, this dazzling first novel of
                    mischief and feathers, brings to life the singular poetry of the industrial chicken.</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>In Greek myth, Alcestis is known as the ideal wife; she loved her husband so much that she died and
                    went to the underworld in his place. In this vividly-imagined debut, Katharine Beutner gives voice
                    to the woman behind the ideal and reveals the part of the story that’s never been told: What
                    happened to Alcestis in the three days she spent in the underworld?</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Kore has lived her entire life under her resentful mother Demeter’s shadow, trying her hardest to
                    please a woman grown bitter by betrayal. With her self-esteem in tatters and deliberately isolated
                    by her mother, it’s no surprise that Kore is flummoxed when she meets a collection of otherworldly
                    women – the Goddesses of Olympus – who tell her that her mother is in truth a Goddess herself. Kore
                    tells them her preferred name, Persephone, and hopes they will not only have answers for her new
                    questions, but the friendship and love she craves. Instead, an imposing and stoic figure emerges
                    from a nearby cave on a magical chariot and snatches Persephone away.</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Iphigenia seems to have it all.

                    As the eldest daughter of the House of Atreus and princess of Mycenae, Iphigenia has had an idyllic
                    childhood despite her family’s bloodstained history. She is the darling of the people of her city,
                    and at her side are her endearingly annoying sister Electra and adorable baby brother Orestes. As
                    she comes of age, however, that fragile peace is threatened by strange, burgeoning feelings for her
                    handmaiden. Amidst this crisis of identity, another looms as an ancient goddess only Iphigenia can
                    see simmers beneath the surface of reality. All of this falls to the back burner when war with the
                    Trojans looms high on the horizon, and Iphigenia’s father summons her with a proposal of marriage
                    she would go to the ends of the earth to avoid.
                    <br><br>
                    In a desperate attempt to circumnavigate her fate, Iphigenia discovers a dark truth: the altar her
                    father intends for her is sacrificial rather than matrimonial. It is only by an act of divine
                    intervention that she survives, and it is by divine retribution that she will have her revenge.
                    <br><br>
                    It is from the desecrated shores of Aulis that Iphigenia will embark on a journey that will take her
                    from the furthest reaches of the ancient Mediterranean to the underworld itself. Amidst romances
                    with goddesses and her own terrifying deification, Iphigenia plots. Despite the pleas of everyone
                    around her, she vows that blood will soon stain the marble halls of the House of Atreus once again.
                    <br><br>
                    Vengeance is sweet, but as Iphigenia soon discovers, it comes at a price that could cost her
                    everything.

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>“When I was asked to choose a myth to write about, I realized I had chosen already. The story of
                    Atlas holding up the world was in my mind before the telephone call had ended. If the call had not
                    come, perhaps I would never have written the story, but when the call did come, that story was
                    waiting to be written. Rewritten. The recurring language motif of Weight is ‘I want to tell the
                    story again.’ My work is full of cover versions. I like to take stories we think we know and record
                    them differently. In the retelling comes a new emphasis or bias, and the new arrangement of the key
                    elements demands that fresh material be injected into the existing text. Weight moves far away from
                    the simple story of Atlas’s punishment and his temporary relief when Heracles takes the world off
                    his shoulders. I wanted to explore loneliness, isolation, responsibility, burden, and freedom, too,
                    because my version has a very particular end not found elsewhere.” -- from Jeanette Winterson’s
                    Foreword to Weight
