                <h3>Rating: 5/5</h3>
                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>In the vein of The Pisces and The Vegetarian, Chlorine is a debut novel that blurs the line between a
                    literary coming-of-age narrative and a dark unsettling horror tale, told from an adult perspective
                    on the trials and tribulations of growing up in a society that puts pressure on young women and
                    their bodies... a powerful, relevant novel of immigration, sapphic longing, and fierce, defiant
                    becoming.</p>
                <h3>My Thoughts:</h3>
                <p>I chose this book because it had a cool looking cover, so I had no idea that it was a horror book. A
                    very well written an impressive debut book about competetive swimming, racism, the horror or growing
                    up as a woman, and having a strong urge of becoming a mermaid instead.</p>

                <h3>Rating: 2/5</h3>
                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at
                    an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the
                    humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality
                    they slip gradually from obsession to corruption and betrayal, and at last—inexorably—into evil.</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Fowl Eulogies is an absurd fairy tale for the ethical carnivore, fiction of perfect madness, of
                    brutal and unprecedented humor. From the meadow to the supermarket, this dazzling first novel of
                    mischief and feathers, brings to life the singular poetry of the industrial chicken.</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>In Greek myth, Alcestis is known as the ideal wife; she loved her husband so much that she died and
                    went to the underworld in his place. In this vividly-imagined debut, Katharine Beutner gives voice
                    to the woman behind the ideal and reveals the part of the story that’s never been told: What
                    happened to Alcestis in the three days she spent in the underworld?</p>

                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p>Kore has lived her entire life under her resentful mother Demeter’s shadow, trying her hardest to
                    please a woman grown bitter by betrayal. With her self-esteem in tatters and deliberately isolated
                    by her mother, it’s no surprise that Kore is flummoxed when she meets a collection of otherworldly
                    women – the Goddesses of Olympus – who tell her that her mother is in truth a Goddess herself. Kore
                    tells them her preferred name, Persephone, and hopes they will not only have answers for her new
                    questions, but the friendship and love she craves. Instead, an imposing and stoic figure emerges
                    from a nearby cave on a magical chariot and snatches Persephone away.</p>
